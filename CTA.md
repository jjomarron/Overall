# Doors Closing: How have rideshares and demographic changes affected CTA ridership?
This project was developed in my Public Sector Economics graduate class at DePaul University. Many thanks to Professor Gabriella Bucci for the phenomenal class and especially for helping improve the conciseness of my economic writing.

## Overview
This project came out of personal interest for me inspired by a few changes I had witnessed. After two years away in the Peace Corps, I came back to see some of the familiar places I had known and loved in Chicago had been transformed and gentrified. I saw people not as familiar with the transit system as Ubers and Lyfts became more popular. I also was personally affected by cuts to our transit system in high school. I knew these changes were not happening in silos so I wanted to explore the relationship between rideshares, demographics, and CTA ridership as a proxy or initial understanding of how gentrification might be affecting our transit system.

## Key facts/concepts to know (Tableau graphs to be included later)
* Real median income has trended down in Chicago over the last 20 years
* Chicago's Black population has decreased substantially since 2000
  * CTA claimed in 2009 that 60% of their ridership identifies as a minority
  * Latino, White, and Asian populations are growing their shares of the total population
* Real operating expenses have increased steadily since 2006
* The "death spiral" is a concept in transit literature that identifies a funding/ridership crisis on public transit systems
  * A "death spiral" can occur from a loss of funding, worse service, or a loss of ridership. The three contribute to a hard-to-stop cycle
    * A loss of riders means less funding. Less funding means worse service. Worse service means less riders. The cycle continues until the system is extremely limited or until an intervention occurs

## Research Question and Hypotheses
My driving research question was: **How have rideshares and demographic changes affected CTA ridership?** After determining those impacts, I also wanted to explore how certain neighborhoods might have been affected in order to understand the shifts in equity behind any of the ridership effects.
