# Python Projects

As I mentioned in the initial page, my Python projects are more personal hobbies that I used in order to practice and learn the language. Here I am sharing three personal projects that will link to the individual code as well as more substantial explanations. Enjoy!

## 1: Automate Baseball Lineup and Pitch Count
I work part time with a youth baseball team and have been consulting with the coaches on how to develop a lineup and track how many pitches a kid can throw under youth baseball recommended guidelines. This program is designed to allow coaches to spend less time making subjective lineup decisions and more time managing the game and helping the kids perform to their potential.

## 2: [WebScraping for a Fantasy Soccer League](Fantasy Soccer.md)
A group of friends and I are in a personally operated Fantasy Soccer League that is conducted over Excel to allow us more flexibility and engagement. However, we all run into periods where updating the numbers for each player takes a long time for our team. Furthermore, independently verifying other teams would be overly cumbersome. This project is in early stages but I am looking to automate the data updates for each team so that we do not have to spend so much time operating on   

## 3: [SMS Trigger for a Python Script](SMS Trigger.md)
This project is going in tandem with my growing list of Python projects as well as future ones. I am planning on building a server where I will host all my Python scripts so I do not have to use my daily computer to run scripts. With this script, my friends can also update their fantasy teams, youth coaches can request their lineup and pitch count info on their terms, and I can run any codes while away from my computer.
