# STATA Projects

STATA is my strongest data analysis language, where I have spent the majority of my programming time, as well as where I have completed my most substantial projects. My skillset was developed heavily during my time in my Master's Program. Many thanks to my Professors at DePaul University for the support and guidance during my various research project. Here are a few projects I have conducted in STATA exhibiting my skills both as a coder as well as a data analyst.
