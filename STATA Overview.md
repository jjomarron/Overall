# STATA Projects

STATA is my strongest data analysis language, where I have spent the majority of my programming time, as well as where I have completed my most substantial projects. My skillset was developed heavily during my time in my Master's Program. Many thanks to my Professors at DePaul University for the support and guidance during my various research project. Here are a few projects I have conducted in STATA exhibiting my skills both as a coder as well as a data analyst.

## 1: [Doors Closing: How Have Rideshares and Demographic Changes Affected CTA Ridership](CTA.md)
My most substantial project was a final research paper discussing how rideshares (Uber and Lyft) and demographic changes affected CTA ridership. In this project, I delved into the City of Chicago Data Portal where I utilized their Big datasets on rideshares as well as the ones regarding CTA ridership. With regression analysis, I was able to identify how gentrification (using rideshares and demographic changes) was contributing to a decrease in overall ridership as well as a shift in how people were transporting themselves.
