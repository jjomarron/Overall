Hi everyone, welcome to my GitHub! This is my first attempt at creating a repository where I can share my code, solicit feedback, and hopefully pass on what I have learned with others.

# [About Me]

My name is Jack Jomarron and I am a Chicago native, George Washington University and DePaul University graduate, and returned Peace Corps Volunteer. I enjoy connecting with people and tinkering with hobby projects both on and offline. I am currently looking to find a career combining my passions for data analysis and public service to help build a better future for my hometown.

# My Coding Experience
## STATA
STATA is my strongest data analysis language, where I have spent the majority of my programming time, as well as where I have completed my most substantial projects. My skillset was developed heavily during my time in my Master's Program where I conducted analyses with Big Data (5,000,000+ observations), panel data, fixed effects, and conducting ARIMA and other time series models. Many thanks to my Professors at DePaul University for the support and guidance during my various research projects. 

**1: [Doors Closing: How Have Rideshares and Demographic Changes Affected CTA Ridership](CTA.md)**

My most substantial project was a research paper evaluating how rideshares (Uber and Lyft) and demographic changes affected CTA ridership. In this project, I delved into the City of Chicago Data Portal where I utilized their Big datasets on rideshares as well as the ones regarding CTA ridership. With regression analysis, I was able to identify how gentrification (using rideshares and demographic changes as proxies) contributed to a decrease in overall ridership as well as a shift in how Chicagoans were transporting themselves.

**2: [Data Cleaning](Clean Crime.md)**

This example is how I cleaned and compiled various datasets used in a final project during my Master's program. My research partners and I were evaluating the effectiveness of the Chicago Police Department's stops on the amount of crimes on a neighborhood. I took point on cleaning and compiling the datasets so we could conduct machine learning and other more advanced analysis in R. This was cleaning included datasets from Chicago Police Department and the City of Chicago's Data Portal.

**3: [Time Series and ARIMA models](STATA Final.md)**

This code is the one I used for a final exam in my graduate Econometrics II class. The test was designed to call on and combine all the skills I had learned regarding time series and panel data over the quarter. I earned an A for my work on this final.

## Python
Python is the language I have most recently taken up as a hobby to work on personal projects. As of now, it is my favorite programming language for the variety and breadth it provides. I am relatively self-taught utilizing Automate the Boring Stuff, Stack Overflow, and Reddit forums for the bulk of my education. As of now, I have experience with Pandas, web scraping, file path manipulation, loops, try/for exceptions, and setting up webhooks for a SMS trigger. I appreciate any feedback on my Python codes especially on how I might be able to shorten their run times.

**1: [Automate Baseball Lineup and Pitch Count](Auto Lineup + Pitch.md)**

I work part time with a youth baseball team and have been consulting with the coaches on how to automatically develop a lineup and track how many pitches a kid can throw under youth baseball recommended guidelines. This program is designed to allow coaches to spend less time making subjective lineup decisions and more time managing the game and helping the kids perform to their potential.

**2: [WebScraping for a Fantasy Soccer League](Fantasy Soccer.md)**

A group of friends and I are in a personally operated Fantasy Soccer League that is conducted over Google Sheets to allow us more flexibility and engagement. However, we all run into ruts when updating our team's statistics for each player takes too long time or we are too busy. Furthermore, independently verifying other teams is barely attempted as it would be overly cumbersome. This project is in early stages but I am automating the data updates for each team so that we do not have to spend so much time manually gathering data and can enjoy the normal banter of the league.

**3: [SMS Trigger for a Python Script](SMS Trigger.md)**

This project is going in tandem with my growing list of Python projects as well as future ones. I am planning on building a server where I will host all my Python scripts so I do not have to use my daily computer to run scripts. With this script, my friends can also update their fantasy teams, youth coaches can request their lineup and pitch count info on their terms, and I can run any codes while away from my computer.

## SAS
My experience in SAS comes from a graduate level class where we learned about various analytic tools. My takeup on SAS was much quicker than other languages as I had already completed the requisite STATA/Econometrics courses so it was easy adjusting to the syntax. However, I also learned to use SAS to create Neural Network models, utilize machine learning techniques, as well as clustering analysis. 

**1: [Regression Analysis](SAS Regression.md)**

Here is a code I wrote that runs some simple regressions and works on fitting models. I use Adjusted R-Squared, stepwise regressions to develop my own best model. I also evaluate all the different models using key statistics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and more.

**2: [Clustering Analysis](Cluster Analysis.md)**

This code comes from a homework assignment where I conducted a clustering analysis on consumer/product data. The goal of this project was to practice identifying logical subsets of Big Data to eventually apply other analysis methods to discover meaningful conclusions from large datasets.

## R
I learned R in the same graduate level class where I learned SAS. We spent less time on R but again adjusting to the syntax was just a learning curve that I felt comfortable overcoming. I have spent less time on R so I move slower in this language than I do in STATA or SAS but I would love to spend some more time increasing my fluency and take advantage of all that R has to offer.

**1: [Neural Networks](Neural Networks.md)**

Neural Networks is a form of machine learning that seeks to mimic the way the brain operates in order to discover underlying relationships in the data. This code is an introduction to neural networks and how they are created in R. The goal of this project was to select the model that could find the best predictors for those who are delinquent on their loans.

**2: [Regression Analysis](R Regression.md)**

This regression analysis in R contains binary regressions where I conduct a Linear Probability model, Logistic Regression model, and a Random Forest model. The goal of this short project is to determine which model can most strongly identify the likelihood of a default on mortgage payments.

<!--## Tableau (incomplete)
Tableau has been super helpful for me in crafting data visualizations particularly within larger data analysis projects that I have worked on. I enrolled in a free online course as an introduction basic Tableau and have then used it start creating visualizations including various different types of graphs, trend lines, and confidence intervals. I worked for the State of Illinois where I was writing weekly reports that required Tableau graphs. While most of the graphs were already set, I did provide input and make minor adjustments as well as learned more about the inner workings of Tableau and the auto-update capabilities. -->
