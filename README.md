Hi everyone, welcome to my GitHub! This is my first attempt at creating a repository where I can share my code, elicit feedback, and hopefully pass on what I have learned with others.

# [About Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackjomarron/)

My name is Jack Jomarron and I am a Chicago native, George Washington University and DePaul University graduate, and returned Peace Corps Volunteer. I enjoy connecting with people and tinkering with hobby projects both on and offline. I am currently looking to find a career combining my passions for data analysis and public service to help build a better future for my hometown. 

# My Coding Experience
## [STATA](STATA Overview.md)
My first experience coding came with STATA during undergrad at GW in an Econometrics class. While I understand more or less how to program, I definitely left my undergraduate degree without a firm understanding of the concepts I was utilizing in my analysis. After 2 years in the Peace Corps, I returned to school in order to really dive into quantitative analysis and understand how I could utilize data to explain and solve the problems I had seen/experienced both domestically and abroad. As a graduate student, I excelled in my Econometrics class and engaged in higher level analysis with STATA. STATA is my strongest language (particularly when it comes to data analysis) where I have conducted regressions with Big Data (5,000,000+ observations), panel data, conducting ARIMA models, and utilizing loops.
## [Python](Python Overview.md)
Python is the language I have most recently taken up as a hobby to work on personal projects. As of now, it is my favorite language for the variety and breadth it provides. I am relatively self-taught utilizing Automate the Boring Stuff, Stack Overflow, and Reddit forums for the bulk of my education. As of now, I have experience with Pandas, web scraping, file path manipulation, loops, try/for exceptions, and even setting up webhooks for a SMS trigger. I appreciate any feedback on my Python codes especially on how I might be able to shorten their run times.
## [SAS](SAS Overview)
My experience in SAS comes from a graduate level class where we learned about various analytic tools. My takeup on SAS was much quicker than other languages as I had already completed the requisite STATA/Econometrics courses so it was easy to adjusting the syntax. However, I also learned to use SAS to create Neural Network models, utilize machine learning techniques, as well as clustering analysis. 
## [R] (R Overview)
I also learned R in the same graduate level class where I learned SAS. We spent less time on R but again adjusting to the syntax was just a learning curve that I felt comfortable overcoming. I have less time spent on R so I would move slower in this language than I would in STATA or SAS but would love to spend some more time increasing my fluency and take advantage of all that R has to offer.
